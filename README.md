It can help you stay on track and help you understand what‚Äôs expected of you. Your recovery plan should include goals for functioning, social relationships, and recovery. Your recovery plan should also include information about the symptoms you experience, and how they affect your life. You and your healthcare team should review your recovery plan regularly to make sure it‚Äôs still relevant and to make changes as you need.The recovery process takes time, and recovery does not happen overnight.
